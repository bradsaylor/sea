title: About SEA
---



I have worked in the loudspeaker industry for over 15 years.  Most of that time was spent at the American firm Sound United work on the Polk Audio and Definitive Technology brands.

As a senior acoustic and electronics systems engineer I have developed both active and passive products in the 
categories of:
-	Sound Bars
-	Docking Stations
-	Personal Bluetooth
-	Commercial Distributed Systems
-	Home Theater Systems
-	Subwoofers

Through my experience in developing active products I have become proficient at specifying and deploying DSP architectures to achieve the required sonic goals.  This includes the use of many Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, and Intersil chips.

In many of my projects I served as lead for transducer development and have gained experience in specifying, modeling, and measuring transducers.  This includes FEA analysis using the COMSOL multiphysics package and motor design using the Loudsoft Fine Motor software.

As lead acoustic systems engineer I have a well-developed ear and have successfully tuned many commercially available products.  I am equally comfortable with analog crossover circuit design and digital DSP tuning to achieve a desired sound.  As a lover of music and an accomplished guitarist I understand what makes a speaker sound great and how use the engineering tools available to achieve this goal.

In my work I seek out and use the best tools available to accomplish my task.  In addition to the software mentioned above I am a frequent user of MATLAB for data analysis, LEAP and SoundEasy for loudspeaker modeling and measurement, and frequently write my own applications in the C programming language to increase my productivity.

By combining an expertise in acoustics, electronics, and transducers I offer a unique value to the potential client.
